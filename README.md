Route Optimizer for Big Distance Matrix for Google Maps
=======================

Javascript object for find optimal routes for Big Distance Matrices for Google Maps.

It takes a distance matrix between given locations obtained using Google Maps API using the <a href="https://github.com/davcs86/gmaps-bigdistancematrix" target="_blank">Big Distance Matrix for Google Maps</a> and computes the shortest route to travel to the locations.

This object implements the Ant Colony Algorithm to get the shortest path using distance, time or speed (distance/time) as optimization variables.

It can display the optimal route on a HTML div or export it as an array in JSON format.
